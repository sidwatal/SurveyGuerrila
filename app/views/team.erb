    <p>Remember those amazing pie-charts you saw on the analytics page. That was this guy.</p>
    <p>Remember how you had to login to view the dashboard. Also this guy.</p>
    <p>Remember that time you felt someone was watching you from across the room filling you with a sense of dread and unease. I can't prove anything, but it was probably this guy too.</p>

    <p>Sherm took Survey Guerrilla from one AJACK to many AJAX.</p>
    <p>Your ability to create surveys would not exist if it wasn't for him.</p>
    <p>When not coding, Sherman enjoys looking down on people who don't have his refined pallete and fashion sense.</p>

    <p>In his previous careers, Sid has been a firefighter and an exotic dancer.</p>
    <p>Now, he creates janky jQuery(this page) and gives users the ability to take surveys.</p>
